# ngx-reduxor

## Intro
Initially created by Netanel Basal (called ngrx-generator), I forked it to update it to my needs. But after some times, 
and using the recommendations of the community, the generator has been improved. 

## Getting Started

Install it via npm:

```shell
npm install ngx-reduxor -g
```

or with Yarn:
```shell
yarn add global ngx-reduxor
```

## Usage

```shell
ngx-reduxor
```

And then, follow the instructions... ;-)
